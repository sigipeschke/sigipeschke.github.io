                <p class="para">I have developed four interactive and fun games using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to enhance my skills in web development. The first two games, Tic Tac Toe and 2048, are popular puzzle games that challenge players to think strategically. The second two games, War and BlackJack, are classic card games that provide an engaging experience for players. These projects were not only an opportunity to learn and improve my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but also allowed me to create entertaining and enjoyable games that can be played by anyone.</p>
