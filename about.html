        <p class="about">
            I am a highly motivated, self-taught computer science professional with a background in physics and a passion for solving complex problems. As a graduate of the University of Calgary with a degree in physics, I have a unique perspective on problem-solving and analytical thinking that I bring to my work in computer science.
            <br><br>
            My technical skills are broad and include expertise in programming languages and frameworks such as Python, Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. I have experience in building web-based applications and an understanding of the full software development life cycle. Additionally, I have a strong interest in machine learning and have hands-on experience with neural networks and TensorFlow.
            <br><br>
            My background in physics has also given me a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and problem solving. This has allowed me to approach complex computer science problems in a methodical and logical manner, and to devise efficient solutions. Furthermore, my physics background has also made me a very adaptable learner, able to quickly pick up new technologies and programming languages.
            <br><br>
            As a professional, I am dedicated to making a positive impact in the world and enhancing the lives of those around me. I am excited to bring my skills, passion, and analytical thinking to a new role where I can continue to grow and develop as a computer scientist. I am confident that my unique background and experiences make me a valuable asset to any team and I am eager to work with a forward-thinking company that values creative problem solving and continuous learning.
